My ALT is 33 U/L. Is this within a safe range for my liver, especially since I am taking atorvastatin for cholesterol?
Since I have high cholesterol and take atorvastatin, should I be concerned about liver damage, and should we check my liver function more often?
Would my ALT level of 33 U/L be affected by my current medications, and should I avoid certain pain relievers like acetaminophen?
My chloride level is at 105 mmol/L. Is this a concern for my kidney function or hydration status?
