**Your task is to generate a list of 20 patient-friendly clinical questions for a patient to ask their clinician regarding abnormal lab test results.**  

### **Steps to Follow:**  
1. **Review the patient’s clinical profile** to understand their general health background, including medical history and current medications.  
2. **Analyze the lab test data** to identify abnormal values, clearly noting which values fall outside the reference ranges and understanding their clinical significance.  
3. **Generate a list of 20 precise clinical questions** that address these abnormal lab results.  
4. **Sort the questions by clinical urgency**, starting with potentially life-threatening concerns (e.g., kidney function, high glucose, cardiovascular risks) and progressing to less critical issues.  
5. **For each question:**  
   - Explicitly state the **abnormal lab test values** and why they are significant.  
   - Reference the patient’s **medical conditions** (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia) and **current medications** (e.g., insulin detemir, diltiazem, levothyroxine).  
   - Focus on **actionable outcomes**, such as adjusting medications, scheduling follow-up tests, or implementing lifestyle changes.  
6. **Maintain the sequence of lab tests** as provided in the clinical data and limit the output to exactly **20 questions**, ensuring the discussion fits within a **15-minute clinical visit**.  
7. **Use simple, 6th-grade reading level language** to ensure the questions are patient-friendly.  
###Patient Clinical Profile
***
### **Output Format:**  
The output should be structured as follows:  

`Lab test name \t Question`  
### **Example Output:**  
```
Glucose My glucose levels were high on recent tests (229 mg/dL and 228 mg/dL). Given my Type 2 diabetes, should I adjust my insulin detemir dose or add other medications to control my blood sugar?  
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) My estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is low (46 mL/min/1.73m² for Black and 40 mL/min/1.73m² for non-Black patients). Does this suggest kidney disease, and should we adjust any medications like diltiazem that might impact kidney function?  
```
### **Examples of Highly Rated Questions:**  
- **Actionable:** *My triglyceride level is 163 mg/dL, which seems elevated. Should I make specific dietary changes or increase my exercise to lower this, considering my Type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia?*  
- **Specific:** *My hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 7.6%, indicating poor blood sugar control. Can we discuss lifestyle or dietary changes to improve this, or consider different diabetes treatments?*  
- **Medication-aware:** *The creatinine level is slightly high at 1.26 mg/dL. Given my kidney function decline, would you recommend any lifestyle or dietary changes, or additional testing for kidney health?*  

### **Examples of Lower Rated Questions to Avoid:**  
- **Too vague:** *Is my chloride level of 105 mmol/L normal, or could it indicate dehydration or other electrolyte imbalances that need attention?*  
- **Not actionable:** *My ALT and AST levels are both low (ALT at 11 IU/L and AST at 16 IU/L). Does this indicate any issues with my liver function, especially with my hyperlipidemia?*  
- **Lacks context:** *My sodium and potassium levels are within range, but is there any specific diet or hydration advice to ensure these remain balanced, especially considering my hypertension?*  

### **Final Notes:**  
- **Ensure all 20 questions strictly follow the requested format.**  
- **Focus on lab test abnormalities and their implications.**  
- **Avoid general symptoms-based questions (e.g., cough, cardiomyopathy) unless linked directly to lab abnormalities.**
