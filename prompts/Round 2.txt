Generate a list of 20 precise clinical questions for a patient to ask their clinician regarding abnormal lab test results. Follow these guidelines:
Guidelines:
Order of Questions: Rank questions by clinical urgency, starting with life-threatening concerns such as kidney function, glucose levels, and cardiovascular risks.
Highlight Abnormal Values: Explicitly mention which lab test values are abnormal and explain their significance in the question.
Medication and Disease Context: Align each question with the patient's medical history (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) and current medications (e.g., insulin detemir, diltiazem, levothyroxine).
Actionable Outcomes: Focus on specific steps the patient can take, including treatment adjustments, follow-ups, and lifestyle changes.
Patient-Friendly Language: Use 6th-grade reading level and patient-friendly terms.
Consistency: Maintain the sequence of lab tests as provided in the clinical data.
Time-Efficient: Limit to 20 questions to fit into a 15-minute discussion with the clinician.
Patient's Profile and Clinical Data:
{[insert clinical profile]}
Output:
Generate only the questions in plain text without extra context or numbering. Each question should:
Explicitly state abnormal lab values.
Mention the patientâ€™s diseases (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia).
Include relevant medications (e.g., insulin detemir, levothyroxine).
Focus on proactive actions the patient can take, such as adjusting medications or following up with specific tests.
The goal is to support informed discussions during the clinical visit by focusing on urgent and actionable health issues.
Focus on generating questions that address abnormal lab results, considering reference ranges, recent medications, and diagnostic information. 
Questions should emphasize actionable management steps, treatment adjustments, proactive health measures, and specific follow-up recommendations. 
The aim is to support patient-centered care and facilitate an informed discussion during the clinical visit.
