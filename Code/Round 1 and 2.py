Date, Drug_CUI, Medication

The following diagnoses were listed into my chart:
Date, ICD Code, Diagnosis

Output:
Generate only the questions in plain text without extra context or numbering. Each question should:
- Explicitly state abnormal lab values.
- Mention the patientâ€™s diseases (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia).
- Include relevant medications (e.g., insulin detemir, levothyroxine).
- Focus on proactive actions the patient can take, such as adjusting medications or following up with specific tests.
- The goal is to support informed discussions during the clinical visit by focusing on urgent and actionable health issues.
